### Requirement
```
Python: 2.7.11 
Numpy: 1.10.4 
Theano: 0.8.2 
Blocks: 0.1.1 
Fuel: 0.1.1 
```

### Entity Typing
There are implementation for distant supervised as well as multi-instance multi-label (MIML) entity typing models. 
The script used for that is here:  
[train2level.py](https://github.com/yyaghoobzadeh/noise_mitigation/blob/master/src/typing/train2level.py)  
And, the configs are in the "configs" subdirectory. 

### Type-aware Releation Extraction
